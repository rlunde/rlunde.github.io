Hi there!

Thanks for coming by.

I'm Ron Lunde, a software developer and fiction writer, currently in Pittsburgh, PA, USA.

All of the projects here are just silly side projects, mostly just to help me learn various new (to me) programming languages and frameworks. At some point, I hope that these projects are "done enough" that they're actually of some use to someone.

Since I mostly work on this stuff when I'm really tired at the end of the day, I don't expect to make very rapid progress towards learning everything I want to, or finishing these projects. However...let's say that since there really aren't a lot of languages or frameworks involved, I somehow managed to get about 5% better at these languages and frameworks every week. Also, let's say that I'm starting with an average skill level of 1% of the average programmer who uses these things regularly.

Let's see how I compare to average over time:

After the first two months, I'm still pretty pathetic:
1.05% after week 0
1.28% after week 4
1.55% after week 8
...
But after a whole year of working at it, I'm 13% as good at them as people who use them regularly!
10.92% after week 48
13.27% after week 52
16.14% after week 56
...
And after two whole years of steady progress? Now we're talking!
138.08% after week 100
167.83% after week 104
204.0% after week 108

See? Easy peasy. Now all I have to do, is do it! :-)
